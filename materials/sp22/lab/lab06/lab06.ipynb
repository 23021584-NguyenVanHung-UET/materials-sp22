    "After such an extensive introduction to programming for data science, we are finally moving into the section of the course where we can apply our new skils to answer real questions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll use testing techniques that were introduced in lecture to test the idea of the therapeutic touch, the idea that some practitioner can feel and massage your human energy field. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Lab Queue**: You can find the Lab Queue at [lab.data8.org](https://lab.data8.org/). Whenever you feel stuck or need some further clarification, add yourself to the queue to get help from a GSI or academic intern! Please list your breakout room number and purpose on your ticket!\n",

    "**Grading**: Here are the policies for getting full credit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To receive credit for this lab notebook (8% final grade), you must submit it by **Friday March 4th at 5pm**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Submission**: Once you're finished, scroll up to the top of the page, and run every cell in the notebook.  Select \"Save\" in the File menu (please don’t hit Save As), then rerun the last cell of the notebook.  The result will contain a zip file that you can submit to Gradescope. If you are in lab, you can submit a ticket on lab.data8.org to ask a staff member to check you off. "

    "\n",
    "Emily took 21 TT practitioners and used them for her science experiment. She would take a TT practitioner and ask them to extend their hands through a screen (which they can't see through). Emily would be on the other side and would flip a fair coin. Depending on how the coin landed, she would put out either her left hand or her right hand. The TT practitioner would then have to answer which hand Emily put out. If a pracitioner could truly interact with a person's HEF, it would be expected that they answered correctly.\n",

    "Overall, through 210 samples, the practitioner picked the correct hand 44% of the time. \n",

If this area is small enough, we’ll declare that the observed data are inconsistent with our simulated model.
